## VcoZfLogger - Zend Framework 2 logger module.
Wrapper for Zend/Logger/Log which allows users to track exceptions, add default "extra" attributes to track and automatic injection of mail transport for mail writer and mongo client/db for mongo writer.  

## Installation
### Composer
 * Install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
 * Install the module using Composer into your application's vendor directory. Add the following line to your `composer.json`.

 ```json
 {
    "require": {
        "vcomedia/vco-zf-logger": "dev-master"
    }
 }
```
 * Execute ```composer update```
 * Enable the module in your ZF2 `application.config.php` file.

 ```php
 return array(
     'modules' => array(
         'VcoZfLogger'
     )
 );
 ```
 * Copy and paste the `vco-zf-logger/config/module.vco-zf-logger.local.php.dist` file to your `config/autoload` folder and customize it with your configuration settings. Make sure to remove `.dist` from your file. Your `module.vco-zf-logger.local.php` might look something like the following:

  ```php
 <?php

 return array(
     'VcoZfLogger' => array(
     )
 );
  ```
